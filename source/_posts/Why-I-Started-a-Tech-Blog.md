This is my first post. I guess I would like to discuss why I decided to start a tech blog. Hopefully I can convince you to start one too.

## To Share My Knowledge and Experience
As a CS student or an IT professional, very often we google technical issues online. 9 out 10 times the solutions are hidden somewhere in a StackOverflow post or someone's tech blog. I have to admit that if not because these reservoirs of knowledge, I don't think I can even complete my colleague as an Information System major. Despite getting so much help from the community, I did not really contribute anything back all these years. Feeling guilty, I think it is time for me to do something, be it something small like a regular expression for validation, or a complex technical solution I discovered, you never know one day it may safe someone's ass! 

## To Document What I learnt
Documenting and summarizing can enforce what you learnt, everyone knows it. However, not many of us can do it diligently. People learnt from their mistakes provided they remember them, I couldn't remember how many times I have to search the internet on technical issues I have faced before, but just could not remember the details. Tech blog can be good platform to record technical solutions I came across before and documenting the details I hope I can make them truly part of my knowledge. 


## To Improve my Writing
As you may already able to tell, I am not good at writing. Ever since I started working, my writing skill has gone from bad to worst. As an IT professional, I often have to create technical documents, which always follow some templates and does not require much creativity. The closest thing I wrote these days required some writing skills are emails, but they need to be professional and concise. On the other hand, writing on a personal tech blog does not have to bond to rules and templates, and hopefully I can improve my writing skills in the process. 

## To Use It as My CV
In the age of social media, having a tech blog with meaningful contents, will definitely improves your exposure to job recruiters. A resume or LinkedIn page can only hold so much information about yourself, a personal tech blog can provide a better insight of one's area of expertise, and interest. Hence helps the recruiter in identifying suitable jobs for you.    

## Conclusion
In conclusion, if you are like me, wanting to contribute back to the IT community; wanting to enforce your learning and improve your writing skill; at the same time trying to catch the eyes of recruiters, may be it is time for you to start a tech blog too!
